Blender add-on template with the initial add-on structure that you can use as a base for the Blender add-on development. 

By default it will just spawn a text object in the scene. Default text is "Hello World!" but can be changed through UI.

It also comes with the `zip_addon_release.py` script to create a add-on release .zip that you can distribute for the later installation.
